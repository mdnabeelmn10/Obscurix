##  Features

| **Feature**                                | **Description** |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **PII Redaction Engine**                   | Real-time masking of sensitive data such as emails, phone numbers, passwords, API keys, card numbers, and bank account details using regex and NLP. |
| **Generative AI Rewriting**                | Uses Google Gemini to rewrite redacted content while preserving the original context and softening tone, especially in sensitive or negative sentiment messages. |
| **Admin Monitoring Dashboard**             | Displays analytics for flagged content, user behavior trends, and PII redaction frequency in real time. |
| **Multilingual Redaction Support**         | Redaction and rewriting supported for English, Hindi, and Spanish using spaCy’s NER and GenAI’s language-agnostic capabilities. |
| **Dual-Mode Redaction (Strict & Creative)**| Strict mode performs full redaction; Creative mode redacts and then rephrases the content while maintaining meaning. |
| **Leak Prevention Browser Extension**      | Chrome/Edge extension that uses OCR and NLP to detect and block screenshots or copied code/text containing sensitive info before it is posted to social media. |
| **Code Sanitization & Pseudocode Conversion** | Automatically converts code to anonymized pseudocode to ensure safe collaboration without exposing internal logic or credentials. |
| **Sentiment-Aware Moderation**             | Detects and softens toxic or harmful language, ensuring that content is emotionally neutral or constructive. |
| **Cognitive Code Obfuscation via GenAI**   | Converts flagged code into obfuscated pseudocode while explaining the logic, allowing safe public sharing (e.g., StackOverflow). |
| **Sensitivity Scoring System**             | Assigns a numeric risk score (0–100) to messages based on redacted content and sentiment, enabling proactive flagging. |
| **Audit Trail & Reporting Dashboard**      | Tracks redaction activity, sentiment trends, and high-risk users or teams; helps enterprises monitor compliance. |

##  OCR + Browser Extension

Custom extension (Chrome/Edge):
- Detects screenshots and copied code/text using **Tesseract OCR**
- Uses NLP + RegEx to identify sensitive data
- Prevents leaks by blocking attempted posts to:
  - Twitter
  - Reddit
  - StackOverflow
  - GitHub

---

##  Scoring & Analytics

Every redaction is assigned a **risk score (0–100)**:
